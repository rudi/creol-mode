1 Overview 
~~~~~~~~~~~

This is creol-mode.el, an Emacs major mode for the programming /
modelling language Creol.  Creol is being developed at the University of
Oslo, Department of Informatics.  For further information about the
language, see [http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~creol/].

3 Installation 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add these lines to your `~/.emacs' file:

(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/creol-mode")
(autoload 'creol-mode "creol-mode" nil t)
(unless (assoc "\\.creol\\'" auto-mode-alist)
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.creol\\'" . creol-mode)))

4 Usage 
~~~~~~~~

Creol-mode should be active automatically when you open a file of type
`.creol'.  The key `C-c C-c' (`creol-next-action') compiles the buffer
with creolc or starts the Maude interpreter.

To compile the buffer, `creol-next-action' calls `make' if the current
directory contains a Makefile; otherwise, the Creol compiler is called
with the current file.  To use another compile command, set the local
variable `creol-compile-command'.  This is not a customize option since
the compile command will in general be different for every file (e.g. different `make' targets).

By default, `creo-next-action' starts the Maude interpreter and loads
the compiled model if it exists and is newer than the Creol source.  The
name of the compiled model is assumed to be the same as the current
buffer but with a `.maude' extension.  Set the local variable
`creol-output-file' to choose another name for the compiled model.
