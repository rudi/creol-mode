1 Overview 
~~~~~~~~~~~

This is creol-mode.el, an Emacs major mode for the programming /
modelling language Creol.  Creol is being developed at the University of
Oslo, Department of Informatics.  For further information about the
language, see [http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~creol/].

3 Installation 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add these lines to your `~/.emacs' file:

(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/creol-mode")
(autoload 'creol-mode "creol-mode" nil t)
(unless (assoc "\\.creol\\'" auto-mode-alist)
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.creol\\'" . creol-mode)))

4 Usage 
~~~~~~~~

Creol-mode should be active automatically when you open a file of type
`.creol'.  The key `C-c C-c' (`creol-next-action') compiles the buffer
with creolc or starts the Maude interpreter.

By default, `creo-next-action' starts the Maude interpreter and loads a
file with the same name as the current buffer but with a `.maude'
extension, if such a file exists and is newer than the file being
edited.  Set the local variable `creol-output-file' if
`creol-next-action' compiles to a different output file.
